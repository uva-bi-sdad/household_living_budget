ACS 5-YR household data from the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.

NOTES (taken from IPUMS): 
To load data, you must download both the extract's data and the DDI
and also set the working directory to the folder with these files (or change the path below).

Also, make sure to install packages in R: install.packages('ipumsr')

The data set loads with these two lines:

ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("--file name--.xml")
data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)
