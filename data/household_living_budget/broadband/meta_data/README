Here is a link to Broadband Now the source for the broadband data: https://broadbandnow.com/.
"BroadbandNow’s data has been used and cited by the FCC, U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Bank, 
Microsoft, Facebook, Harvard University, MIT, and many other academic and public institutions. They have been 
collecting and maintaining coverage, pricing, and plan information for all U.S. internet providers since 2015. 
Government data on internet coverage is typically 12-18 months old, but we seek out more recent updates from 
hundreds of internet providers. We also provide practical guides and tools, such as internet resources for 
low-income households, how to select a VPN, a guide to fixing Wi-Fi, and a bandwidth calculator."
